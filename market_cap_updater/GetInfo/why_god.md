# IDK TBH
### Old scraper I used to force a connection instead of requests
### Spent 3 hours on downloading garbage to make the enviroment in python
Can be any alpha release of Maven, but if I download Java 19.0.1 instead of 19 the whole thing goes to shit. Also why does IntelliJ use jdk 19 but the latest on everything else. I had to go to the archives to download this shit 3 times changing PATHS each time before I got to the original Java 19. Shit IDE, why did i need to upload 8 fucjin folders and 11 files to run what couldve done in 20 lines of Go or 10 lines of Python. \
